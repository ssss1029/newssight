Node.js app, similar to Polisight. This is still in the works. 
I am trying to transfer most of the Meteor.js functionality in the polisight repo into Node.js, in order to get more control over the processing

To run (use 3 different terminals):

```
sudo mongod
```

```
redis-server
```

```
npm install 
nodemon serve
```
